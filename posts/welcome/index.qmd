## Why This Blog?

As a researcher and forestry enthusiast, I created this blog to share insights from my academic journey and professional projects. My goal is to blend technology and environmental science, especially in areas like:

-   **Forest ecosystem monitoring** using drones, LiDAR, and multispectral cameras.
-   Developing innovative methods for sustainable forest management.
-   Sharing my personal experiences from research and teaching.

Iâ€™m currently affiliated with the **University of Agriculture in Krakow**, where I actively contribute to scientific and educational activities. You can explore my university profile [here](https://kzzl.urk.edu.pl/pracownicy/jakubmiszczyszyn-15.html).
